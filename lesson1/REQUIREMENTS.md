**1.** The first thing we ll need for sure is a :camel:

**2.** I d say the second most important thing (after the :camel:) is a space in the web where we can put down and use our *TDL*. We chose [uberspace] (http://boene.kochab.uberspace.de/TDL.html) as our webhost.

**3.** To build our *TDL* we need people (people = me, I guess) to be able to view the things that are to do, add new stuff and erase entrys from the list. Thats kinda saying:

> Gimme a pen `n a napkin buddy and I ll make ya a frikin to-do-list in notime!

This guy actually forgot to mention the rubber, but thats just because he had a couple too many drinks ...
Our digital pen, napkin and rubber will be php and html, coupled with MySQL, as far as I know.

My first question here is: Will Apache have to do anything with the *TDL*? Because it will run on uberspace and not my own computer. Do I have some missconception or was Apache "*just*" installed because its generally important and handy if you wanna work and develop stuff which is connected to the internet?

**4.** When it comes to deadlines, I d say you re obv the one that has to answer that requirement.

**5.** Making an appointment for a phone call reminds me of the fact that our only communication via text right now are SMS (and your girlfriends fb, which is kinda lame for everyone. or at least a little unprofessional) and they are costy. We can stay at SMS since they dont cost too much, but being the modern guys that we are, I think we can find a better way.

### Notes and Advice

Ok, that does not look like what i've expected.

About the tasks:

* Write down the requirements for the program were going to build form of clear
  statements. That regards functionality, environment and maybe some other things.
  We'll need them in a less prose-like form than your first attempt. I added a 
  paragraph about that in the README.
* Don't think about the "how" right now. But: You'll need the Apache to have a 
  decent development cycle. That is: "write code -> go browser -> see result"
  instead of "write code -> upload code -> wait -> go browser -> see result" or
  even worse. Uberspace will be the place where your app is finally available 
  on the internet. Maybe ask me more on the next call or just wait.

Some advice:

* Take care that your .md-files have around 80 chars per line. That helps to
  read and edit them in command line text editors. This is also of some value
  for source code files and there are coding guidelines that explicitly demand a
  line length of max 80 chars.
* Take the stuff serious. We will have fun when talking, but this should stay
  outside our documents. To me programming is a lot about transforming chaos
  to structures and clarity. Document like this are parts of such a transformation.
  And i hope we'll be doing this a minimum "as if".
* Nice that you found out about the emoticons :smile:. Finding out what could
  be done with the stuff is some spirit you should maintain.

About communication:

* Let's talk about that on the next phone call.
