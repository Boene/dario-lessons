#### Comment about last version

I wasn t planing on working like this all the time, but it came natural as 
I was trying out the markup stuff. Sorry, no more jokery.
Regarding the length of 80 chars per line: thats unusual for me, but I ll
try to make the program jump to the next line by itself after 80 chars.

So back to the most important matter: The TDL and its requirements.

### **Thoughts about TDL**

- We need webspace for our database and the page itself. In our case this
  is uberspace (http://boene.kochab.uberspace.de/). Of course there needs to
  be at least some space that is accessable for both of us.

- Apache will work as our webserver and like you said, I m gonna learn how to
  use it correctly soon.

- Php will work as our script language. This means it ll take data from the 
  SQL database if demanded and build an html page which will then be send to 
  the client.

- We should install some kind of security, since we dont want random people to
  be able to look up our private schedules.

- There could be a script that sends an email or so, reminding us of some 
  appointment. It would be handy to be able to configure this script for every
  single entry, so that it will i.e. send the mail 1 day in advance or maybe 
  a week if necessary. Sending mails to multiple people would be an idea too.

- The graphical part of the TDL should imo be simple and "robust". I have never
  been a fan of fancy looks for kinda practical jobs. Its unnecessary, takes 
  time to build and has more potential to glitch in some way, I guess.

- The point of communication will be part of our next talk, but one important
  thing for me would be a quicker, less formal "place" to leave short messages.
  Like a facebook, IRC, ICQ kinda chat. Since I think the more flexible we are
  on choosing the way of communication, the more effective it gets.

For now thats all the important stuff that comes to mind. I hope this version 
of the requirements listing is more the way you wanted it to be!

I had some rather busy days and wont be at home today either, but tomorrow I d
be ** *available from 5 pm* ** if you d like to go for the next ** *phone call* **. I hope
you ll not be too hard on my about the notetaking and what you wrote about how
to have a "correct" phone call. That has never been a strength of mine and its
even more unusual while being on the phone (I just know it from meetings ...).
But of course I ll try and look how natural it comes.
