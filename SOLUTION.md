1.) So I downloaded the current version of Ubunto as an .iso file and after some search I was able to install it on a USB-stick via some strange looking program. My first attempt to reboot the computer and boot Ubuntu from the stick was successfull. That was the last successfull moment for some time. After some stuff that doesnt really matter and is part of the past, I am now able to choose win7 or Ubuntu by just connecting the stick before booting or not. 
Also, my internet immediately worked and as far as UbuntuÂ´s responsibility goes, everything works just fine (I guess).

2.) Starting terminal: check
    Captain of navigation: check
    Know and understand most of the commands listed: check
    Create a directory for my sourcecode in home-dir: (give me a sec) ... check

3.) I think I know what a package manager is and I already used it for the whole LAMP thing. Which is the next point: I found out what LAMP means. Its a combination of programs which makes it possible to receive, coordinate, send and manipulate information from the internet. For that we have Linux for the L, Apache, being a webserver, for the A, MySql, being a way to communicate with databases, for the M and PHP, being a script language that builds html serversided, for the P.
Looking at the PM via the terminal will be done soon.

4.) A demon is a program that doesnt directly do something but working in the background and being some kind of invisible buttler (which can be thought of as a demon. I d call it a gnome by the way).
Starting and stoping demons ins apache and mysql will be learned tomorrow! (this file will be updated after that)
Apache is accessable from localhost.
Installing myphpadmin and stuff will be done tomorrow too.

5.) I chose vim and will test it. Alot was there to read about the holy differences between vim and emacs and to some degree I understood em. But it doesnt feel like stuff that is really understood without using them, so it ll take some time.
I test emacs tomorrow, but it feels like there s more important stuff right now. (Just saying that because I m already behind schedule)

6.) A VCS solves some problems that occured when people started programming and projects had to be coordinated. It gives you a systematic overview about changes that were gradually made by you or others and you can jump back to any point of the past and merge different branches of work together without hiring a bunch of dirty bureaucrats.
There are also different kinds of VCS and the one we use is decentralized and awesome!
There s possibly enough to write some books about it but I ll first go and at least use a VCS once before I talk like I d now whats going on here.
At last, yes I installed git and told it name and email, I created a github account as you know, read alot about it and probably will read it again because my memory is awful and follow you on github.
The end.
